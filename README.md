Teamwork & Collaboration (20%)
To maintain a structured and efficient workflow, our team divided the project into two main domains: Technical Development and Diagnostic Engineering.
SHAKTIVELL A/L SIVANESWARAN THEVAR — Technical Foundation & System Optimization
Built the main image-processing pipeline, introducing a color-space conversion technique that uses the Saturation channel to extract edges more reliably than standard grayscale.
Carried out comprehensive pre-testing on multiple datasets to identify suitable threshold levels and distance-transform seed points.
Led the final validation of the Watershed algorithm, ensuring stable segmentation performance for overlapping objects in different background conditions.
SREHARE NAIDU A/L VASU — Diagnostic Analysis & Feature Development
Designed the morphological analysis module, incorporating circularity measurements to classify objects based on shape.
Developed the diagnostic labeling system, including the visual color-coding scheme (Green = circle, Red = capsule) guided by regularity benchmarks.
Enhanced the visual output design, such as the 4-panel comparison view and automated text-labeling for count totals and regularity metrics.
Joint Contribution
Both team members closely collaborated during the Watershed tuning and debugging stage, working together to optimize the separation parameters so that touching pills could be accurately identified and counted.
